description: "Find what a change could break somewhere else before it ships, beyond the diff, and prove the one fact it's safe because of by running real code instead of writing it up. Use for 'blast radius of X', 'what could this break', or reviewing a small diff you don't trust."

# Blast Radius

Load the `blast-radius` skill with `skill({ name: "blast-radius" })` and execute it.

## Input

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Parse Modifiers

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for modifiers:
- `-f` / `--fast`: Lowest reasoning effort. Prioritise speed — skip deliberation, act immediately.
- `-l` / `--low`: Low reasoning effort. Think less, act faster.
- `-h` / `--high`: High reasoning effort. Think more carefully, verify assumptions.
- `-xh` / `--extra-high`: Ultrathink. Maximum reasoning depth — use for complex, high-stakes, or ambiguous tasks.
- `-v` / `--verbose`: Show more detail.
- `-q` / `--quiet`: Minimal output.
- `-i` / `--interactive`: Ask for confirmation at each step.

Any MCP modifier can be appended to steer tool selection: `--gh` GitHub, `--lin` Linear, `--gw` Google Workspace, `--sg` Sourcegraph, `--gln` Glean, `--dd` Datadog, `--sn` Sentry, `--pd` PagerDuty, `--cf` Codeflow, `--cs` Config Service, `--tp` Temporal, `--sf` Snowflake, `--db` Databricks, `--amp` Amplitude.

A reasoning modifier does not license skipping a step the skill names. Lower effort means less deliberation per step, not fewer steps.

## Steps

Follow the `blast-radius` skill exactly as written. Do not improvise around its steps or
substitute your own plan for its plan. If the skill names a subagent, use that subagent.
If it names a reference file, read that file.

Model choice in opencode is which subagent you spawn, not a `task` parameter. The
`pstack-*` agents pin the models; `-read` variants cannot write. Run `/setup-pstack`
to change which model backs which role.

**Suggested next steps:**
- `/how` to understand the affected subsystem
- `/tdd` to pin behavior before changing it
